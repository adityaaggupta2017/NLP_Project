# NLP_Project
The QANTA Diplomacy project involves developing a model that predicts whether messages exchanged between players in the game Diplomacy are deceptive or truthful. The model analyzes in-game conversations and associated metadata to make its predictions. Its performance is evaluated based on how accurately it identifies deceptive and truthful messages.
